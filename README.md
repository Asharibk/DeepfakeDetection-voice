# DeepfakeDetection-voice

Overview

This project aims to develop a deepfake voice detection system using Python and machine learning. With the increasing sophistication of voice synthesis technology, it’s becoming critical to identify artificially generated voices to ensure security and authenticity. This project processes audio data, extracts relevant features, and trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect deepfake voices effectively.

Features

	•	Audio Processing: Utilizes librosa for extracting features like Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and spectrograms.
	•	Data Augmentation: Handles imbalanced datasets using techniques like oversampling to ensure balanced training.
	•	Model Architecture: Implements a CNN with layers for convolution, pooling, and dense connections for classification.
	•	Performance Evaluation: Includes comprehensive evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Getting Started
